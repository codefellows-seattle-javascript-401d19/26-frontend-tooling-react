## Lab 26: Cowsay

### Author:

### Motivation

In this project, I built a frontend application containing a `'click me'` button that generates random cow speak on each click using cowsay and faker. In this application, I configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. I was able to create and render React components to the DOM, add event listeners to React components, and update React component state.

Additionally, this application has a dropdown menu that allows users to select from the following animals: cow, turtle, stegosaurus, whale or squirrel. The selected animal will be displayed to the page along with a random cowsay message. You can view the stegosaurus selection below:
