## Cowsay + React
This is a cowsay generator built on ReactJS. 

## Motivation
I was motivated by an extreme desire to learn web development which led me to enroll in this program which ultimately led me to this assignment. 

## Description
This app has a button you click that says "Click Me". When you click it the cow generates new sayings.
