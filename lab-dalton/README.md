## Lab 26: Cowsay

![Cowsay React]

### Author:

### Motivation

This project is a front end applcation. The "click me" button that appears on the page will generate a random string to be inserted into the cowsay character. I configured webpack to compile Javascript and SASS into a bundle. I then rendered React components to the DOM with event listeners to React components and to update the React component state. 


### Code Style

Standard JavaScript with ES6, SASS, CSS, HTML
