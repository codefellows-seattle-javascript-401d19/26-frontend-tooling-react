# Cowsay using React

This app using React and Cowsay to make a cow dynamically render on the page using the say function from cow and a few calls from Faker for what the cow says.

Clicking on the button renders just the changes of the page with new information for the saying for the cow each time.

There are two classes so the cow can be duplicated on the page more easily.
